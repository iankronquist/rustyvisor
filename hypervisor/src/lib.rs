#![no_std]
#![feature(lang_items)]
#![allow(unknown_lints)]
#![warn(missing_docs)]

//! A library implementing a mostly-passthrough hypervisor.
//! A mostly passthrough hypervisor mostly virtualizes the guest and does very
//! little emulation of hardware or devices, but can be used to inspect guest
//! state.
//! This library is expected to be embedded in a loader environment, e.g. a
//! UEFI runtim service or a Linux kernel module.
//!
//! This library exports the [VCpu structure](struct.VCpu.html), and four functions.
//! The loader environment is expected to allocate and initialize a VCpu for
//! each logical core, and then load the hypervisor.
//! The loader environment may unload the hypervisor or the hypervisor may
//! unload itself.
//!
//! To load the hypervisor:
//! 1. Once globally, call [rustyvisor_load](fn.rustyvisor_load.html)
//! 2. On each logical core, call [rustyvisor_core_load](fn.rustyvisor_core_load.html)
//!
//! To unload the hypervisor after it has been loaded:
//! 1. On each logical core, call [rustyvisor_core_unload](fn.rustyvisor_core_unload.html)
//! 2. Once globally, call [rustyvisor_unload](fn.rustyvisor_unload.html)
